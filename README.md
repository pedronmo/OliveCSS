# OliveCSS
Simple CSS Framework with no style associated. Straight and pure.

Olive CSS Website: labs.pedronmo.net/olivecss

Important Stuff: Don't change this file, if you need to use different values just create
a different CSS file and use it ro re-define classes. This way you can update my
css framework with no problems and the code is more clear and organized.

Grid Info: This CSS uses a 12 grid system

Some Extra Notes: This is an adaptation of the bootstra.

Thanks for using Olive CSS and if it's the case, report any problems to 'olivecss-framework@gmail.com'
